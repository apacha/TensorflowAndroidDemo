# TensorFlow Android stand-alone demo

Android demo source files extracted from original TensorFlow source. (TensorFlow 1.1.0)

To build this demo, you don't need to prepare build environment with Bazel, and it only requires AndroidStudio.

This demo was inspired by https://github.com/miyosuda/TensorFlowAndroidDemo

## Building the libraries yourself
If you would like to build jni codes, download the TensorFlow library from the official sources and build it using Bazel for arm/x86 and then copy the approriate *.so files into this repository
